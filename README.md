# Hangman
Copyright (c) 2017 Blair Davis  

This Github repository contains a straight-forward implementation of the game hangman. Currently the game is implemented as player vs. machine and has five levels of difficulty (1 being the easiest to 5 being the hardest). The user can either guess a letter or the entire word. As a fun touch, all of the words in each level are pulled from the GRE verbal section so this game could be used as a fun way to prep for the test.   

This application uses HTML to set the structure, css to style, and javascript to implement the functionality. Feel free to glance at all source code for implementation specific details.    

This application is currently under copyright. Just as an explicit clarification, this application is written in html, css, and javascript and is intended to be deployed in a private browser via the linux command line.
